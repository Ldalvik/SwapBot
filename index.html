        <p style="color: red;">THIS BOT IS OFFICIALLY OFFLINE. Thank you to everyone who used this service and kept me motivated to maintain it. As of right now, life is busy and I will not be bringing it back online. Forza Tune View/Editor will replace the bot, as it's web based and much more user-friendly. If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can do so on discord using the links above. <br>/><br/> - Root :)</p>

        <h1>What is SwapBot?</h1>
        <p class="intro">SwapBot was created to solve an issue that we've struggled with since
            Forza Horizon 2: Ugly parts on a locked tune. Now you can change that. This bot can change rims, front/rear bumpers,
            side-skirts, hood, rear wing, and body-kits on any tune you want. The tutorials below are also available using the bot.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Finding your tune file</h2>
        <p class="intro">Downloaded tune files are stored in a local folder on your computer. Steam and Xbox (Microsoft) versions have these
        files in different locations, so be sure to read through the below tutorials to get the correct file.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>If you play on the Xbox (Microsoft) version</h3>
        <h5 id="break">Location: C:/Users/[USER]/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.624F8B84B80_8wekyb3d8bbwe/SystemAppData/wgs/[XUID]/
        </h5>
        <p>(You may have 3+ folders (ignore the <code>t</code> folder) in your <code>wgs</code> directory if you have multiple
            accounts signed in.) If you don't know which XUID is yours, it should be the most recently modified
            folder (after you download a tune). Once you're sure you have the right directory, look for a folder that was created 
            at the time you downloaded the tune. If you filter by date modified, you may end up in the savegame folder accidentally.
            To narrow it down, tune folders will ONLY have 2 1kb files and a container file. To get the tune file itself, hover over 
            each file and find the one that is 378 bytes.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>If you play on the Steam version</h3>
        <h5>Location: C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/userdata/[STEAMID]/155136/remote/[XUID]/</h5>
        <p>Steam is a lot simpler. Download your tune and open up the most recently modified directory in the
            <code>remote</code> folder. You should see names along the lines of <code>Tuning_####[date]####.Data</code>
            as well as ones with <code>.header</code> and thumbnails. You want the one that ends in <code>.Data</code>.
            Make sure it's the tune you downloaded by setting it to recently created/modified.
        </p>

        <h2>How to swap rims</h2>
        <p>To get the ID of the rim you want to swap, type <code>/rims</code>. Use the buttons to find your rim by letter.
            Once you find your rim, remember the ID as you'll need it for the command. For example, to switch the rims to
            Work XD9's, you would attach the tune file to the command <code>!rims WOR_XD9</code> and send the message.
            The bot will reply with the tune file that you must REPLACE the old tune file with. If the name isn't the same,
            (trailing (1) or _1) make sure to rename it.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How to swap Aero and Appearance parts</h2>
        <p>To get the index of the part you want on the car, use the default (stock) part as 0. If there is a 3x3 grid,
            the largest index you could put is 8. Note that the tune will say "incompatible" if you go out of bounds.
            This also applies to swapping the body-kit. If there is only one body-kit choice, the command would be
            <code>!bodykit 1</code>. The available aero/appearance commands are <code>!hood</code>, <code>!frontbumper</code>,
            <code>!rearbumper</code>, <code>!skirt</code>, <code>!wing</code>, and <code>!bodykit</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How to send the tune file</h2>
        <p>To send the tune file to the bot, attach it the command you built using the
            above steps. After sending the message, the bot will reply with a message displaying info
            like the car name, original part, new part, and the updated tune file that you will replace the
            old one with.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Read a tune files data</h2>
        <p>To see what rims and part indexes a tune file has, use <code>!info [tuneFile]</code>. If a part returns null, there is no customization
        available for that category.</p>
