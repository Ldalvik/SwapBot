        <h1>What is SwapBot?</h1>
        <p class="intro">Swap Bot was made for rim swapping locked tune files in Forza Horizon 5, but has a few other fun
            commands and more being worked on daily. The tutorial below is also available with the <code>!help swap</code> command.
            <br><br>To start replacing those dirty rims, you need to find the directory your tunes are saved in. Download your tune
            before using the command, as it will make finding the correct file easier.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Finding your tune file</h2>
        <p class="intro">Downloaded tune files are stored in a local folder on your computer. Steam and Xbox (Microsoft) versions have these
        files in different locations, so be sure to read through the below tutorials to get the correct file.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>If you play on the Xbox (Microsoft) version</h3>
        <h5 id="break">Location: C:/Users/[USER]/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.624F8B84B80_8wekyb3d8bbwe/SystemAppData/wgs/[XUID]/
        </h5>
        <p>(You may have 3+ folders (ignore the <code>t</code> folder) in your <code>wgs</code> directory if you have multiple
            accounts signed in.) If you don't know which XUID is yours, it should be the most recently modified
            folder (after you download a tune). Once you are in this folder, you should see a bunch of hashed folder names
            and a container file. Open up the most recently created/modified folder in here as well. You should see a few 1kb
            files and another container file. Hover over each file, and find the one that is 378 bytes.
            This is the file you want to attach to the <code>!swap</code> command.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>If you play on the Steam version</h3>
        <h5>Location: C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/userdata/[STEAMID]/155136/remote/[XUID]/</h5>
        <p>Steam is a lot simpler. Download your tune and open up the most recently modified directory in the
            <code>remote</code> folder. You should see names along the lines of <code>Tuning_####[date]####.Data</code>
            as well as ones with <code>.header</code> and thumbnails. You want the one that ends in <code>.Data</code>.
            Make sure it's the tune you downloaded by setting it to recently created/modified.
        </p>

        <h2>How to find the RIM ID</h2>
        <p><em>NOTE: YOU CAN NOW USE SLASH COMMANDS TO GET THE RIM IDS IN DISCORD. TYPE /RIMS IN THE GROUPCHAT OR BOT'S DMS.</em>
            <br>To find the RIM ID of the rim you want to apply, go to
            <a href="https://github.com/Ldalvik/SwapBot/blob/main/RIM_IDS.txt">RIM IDS</a> and ctrl+f to search for
            your rim. The exact name won't be there so try searching parts of it, or just scroll through it as it's ordered
            by manufacturer.
            <br>
            When using the <code>!swap</code> command, you only need the <code>RIM_ID</code> portion of the text. For example,
            the list gives me WOR_XD9 (XD9), I would only need to type <code>!swap WOR_XD9</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How to send the tune file</h2>
        <p>To send the tune file to the bot, attach it the <code>!swap [RIM_ID]</code> command you built using the
            above steps. After sending the message, the bot will reply with a message displaying info
            like the car name, original rims, and new rims, and the updated tune file that you will replace the
            old one with.</p>
