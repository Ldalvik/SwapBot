          <h1>Welcome to Swap Bot (0.0.2)</h1>
          <h5>Made for swapping rims on locked tune files for Forza Horizon 5, but also contains a
              handful of game commands and more from an old Kik bot. This will be familiar to some as PiBot.</h5>

        <h1>How to use</h1>
        <p>This bot was made for rim swapping locked tune files, but has a few other fun commands and more being worked on daily.
            The tutorial below is also available with the /swap:help command.
            <br><br>To start replacing those dirty rims, you need to find the directory your tunes are saved in.</p>

          <h2>Finding your tune file</h2>
          <h5>If you play on the Xbox (Microsoft) version</h5>
          <h6 style="font-size: 13px">Location: C:/Users/[USER]/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.624F8B84B80_8wekyb3d8bbwe/SystemAppData/wgs/[XUID]/
          </h6>
          <p>(You may have 3+ folders (ignore the <code>t</code> folder) in your <code>wgs</code> directory if you have multiple
              accounts signed in.) If you don't know which XUID is yours, it should be the most recently modified
              folder (after you download a tune). Once you are in this folder, you should see a bunch of hashed folder names
              and a container file. Open up the most recently created/modified folder in here as well. You should see a few 1kb
              files and another container file. Hover over each file, and find the one that is 378 bytes.
              This is the file you want to attach to the !swap command.
          </p>

          <h5>If you play on the Steam version</h5>
          <h6 style="font-size: 13px">Location: C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/userdata/[STEAMID]/155136/remote/[XUID]/</h6>
          <p>Steam is a lot simpler. Download your tune and open up the most recently modified directory in the
              <code>remote</code> folder. You should see names along the lines of <code>Tuning_####[date]####.Data</code>
              as well as ones with <code>.header</code> and thumbnails. You want the one that ends in <code>.Data</code>.
              Make sure it's the tune you downloaded by setting it to recently created/modified.
          </p>

          <h2>How to find the RIM ID</h2>
          <p>To find the RIM ID of the rim you want to apply, go to
              <a href="https://github.com/Ldalvik/SwapBot/blob/main/RIM_IDS.txt">RIM IDS</a> and ctrl+f to search for
              your rim. The exact name won't be there so try searching parts of it, or just scroll through it as it's ordered
              by manufacturer.
              <br>
              When using the <code>/swap</code> command, you only need the <code>RIM_ID</code> portion of the text. For example,
              the list gives me WOR_XD9 (XD9), I would only need to type <code>/swap WOR_XD9</code>
          </p>

          <h5>How to send the tune file</h5>
          <p>To send the tune file to the bot, attach it the <code>/swap [RIM_ID]</code> command you built using the
          above steps. After sending the message, the bot will reply with a message displaying info
              like the car name, original rims, and new rims, and the updated tune file that you will replace the
          old one with.</p>
